3. Implement the research finding through a Project

This software takes a string through argument and then print it on the console in a well presented output.

This was an implementation of Object oriented programming in python.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
